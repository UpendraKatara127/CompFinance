    "# Trading Assignment: Leveraging Vantage API Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will utilize financial data from the Vantage API to develop and implement a trading strategy. The objective is to fetch, analyze, and apply various features to the data, including technical indicators and news sentiment, to inform your trading decisions. This is a high-level assignment designed to enhance your understanding of financial data analysis and algorithmic trading. Feel free to ask doubts whenever. This can easily be scaled into a good resume project so you're not wasting your time doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Complete the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Get Your API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sign up on the [Vantage API website](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to obtain your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Fetch Data from Vantage API\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose the Data:**\n",
    "   - Decide on the type of data needed (e.g., stock prices, forex rates, economic indicators).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Construct the API Request:**\n",
    "   - Example for fetching daily stock data:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=IBM&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetch the Data:**\n",
    "   - Use Python to request the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Analyze and Process the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explore the Data:**\n",
    "   - Print and examine the JSON response to understand its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert JSON to DataFrame:**\n",
    "   - Convert the JSON data into a DataFrame for easier analysis using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Apply Technical Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetch Indicator Data:**\n",
    "   - Example for Simple Moving Average (SMA):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=SMA&symbol=IBM&interval=daily&time_period=10&series_type=close&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Fetch and process SMA data.\n",
    "   - SMA is one of the indicators the least complicated one, However read more and use better indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Incorporate News Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetch News Data:**\n",
    "   - Example URL:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=NEWS_SENTIMENT&symbol=IBM&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Fetch and process news data. News processing is optional as some of you told you have done NLP a bit. This can turn into a good add on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze News Sentiment:**\n",
    "   - Use sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment and integrate this into your trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Develop a Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Your Strategy:**\n",
    "   - Use the processed data and indicators to define buy and sell signals.\n",
    "   - Example: Buy when the closing price is above the 10-day SMA and sell when it is below. (Make better algorithms than this)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Trading Algorithm:**\n",
    "   - Develop a set of rules that dictate when to enter and exit trades based on the indicators and sentiment analysis(Optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Backtest the Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement a Backtesting Framework:**\n",
    "   - Use historical data to test your strategy's performance.\n",
    "   - Calculate key performance metrics such as cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and drawdowns. (Read about them and try to implement)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimize Parameters:**\n",
    "   - Experiment with different time periods and indicators to optimize your strategy.\n",
    "   - Use cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Advanced Strategy: Deep Learning Model (Only for people who know ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Data:**\n",
    "   - Normalize the data and split it into training and testing sets using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build a Deep Learning Model:**\n",
    "   - Use libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras to create a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate the Model:**\n",
    "   - Assess the model's performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backtest the Model:**\n",
    "   - Use the model's predictions to simulate trading and calculate performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Present Your Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Your Process:**\n",
    "   - Keep a detailed record of your methodology, analysis, and findings in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Report:**\n",
    "   - Summarize your trading strategy, backtesting results, and optimization efforts in a report.\n",
    "   - Highlight key insights and potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in fetching and analyzing financial data, applying technical indicators, and developing algorithmic trading strategies. This high-level exercise will enhance your skills in data-driven trading and financial analysis.\n"
